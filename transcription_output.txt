Hold on. Hold on. I have like a health case, but like you say. Okay, no problem. That's fine. I got that. Thank you. Are you still having the same doctor, Dr. Christopher? Yes. Okay. And who do you do your banking with? I see here. It shows the Velt Fargo. Yes. That's the name? Yes. And you receive your money on the first, third or every other like second, third, fourth, Wednesday. So do you receive that? I receive that on the second Wednesday of each month. Second Wednesday of each month. Okay. I do have your routing and account number in my system since that's a taken account. So I want to confirm the routing and account number just to make sure I have it correct in my file. If you can please grab your checkbook or bank statement for me. I will read the numbers for you. Okay. Okay. I don't have any of that in some of you right now. You can grab your debit card. No. I don't want to have that either. I would like to have that. I would greatly appreciate that if you can take a look because that's the last part and I want to move on to the plan. Yeah. I don't have my debit card. You don't have your debit card. No. Then grab your checkbook. You receive your social security on the Velt Fargo bank? Yes. Okay. All right. Now grab your checkbook. I want to confirm the routing and account number. I already have it. Okay. Yeah. It's one I don't use any of that stuff. So I don't know where my checkbook is. Okay. Okay. I just don't have like a checkbook and I will write checks because it is like an automatic. Do you use a cash app online banking? No. How can I get from that? I don't know. What was that? I'm saying how can I get from that information that I have. I want to make sure I have a track here in my file. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Yeah. No. I just don't have any more things to sell. Are you still looking for it? Yeah. I just don't have any of it. Okay. No problem. That's fine. Let's move on. Let's talk about your life insurance. Okay. Are you a believer of cremation or burial? I have a cremated. You want to be cremated? If I can give you a price ranges from $50 to $100 a month. How much do you think you would easily afford to pay so I can get you a good policy in your budget? Yeah. I already have a lot of stuff already paid for. Yeah. But be a replacing that with others. That's what I'm saying. I'm just going to go through the next two society. Hold on a second. Next two society? Yes. Hello? I'm here. Hi, folks. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Somebody else tried calling. I just tried answering their lines. I'm just going to go through. What I'm saying is the policy that I'm going to provide you today. This is going to be very amazing for you. Okay. Okay. You have already chose something. Do the next society. But that is the Trump life insurance plan, honey. Do you know the difference between whole life and Trump life? No. Let me explain you that. Trump life is for the fixed period of time like after five or ten years, Trump life insurance plan expires on you and all the money that you paid in terms of monthly premiums. All the money directly goes to the insurance company and you cannot get anything in return. That's a Trump life insurance plan. What I'm providing you today is the whole life insurance plan that would be with you for the rest of your life. It would never in, never expire on you. Okay. Okay. Yes, ma'am. So that's what I'm saying. I can get you a good policy today. I want to make sure that nobody like nothing is going to come out of your check before your draft date. I want to make sure I would provide you with a policy number today. We just need to submit your application and get you the approval. We don't need the money today. Okay. Okay. That's why I'm asking about your, yes, ma'am. That's why I'm asking about your affordability. Like how much you easily afford to pay every month so I can get you a good policy where you can get the day one coverage, the 200% accidental death benefit, and the cash value benefits as well. Do you know what the cash value is? Yes, I know what cash value is. Yeah. On the Trump life plan that you're talking about, that you're planning to have, you would not get these kind of benefits. Okay. And basically on the term life insurance plan, it just expires on you after some time. Like once you turn 60 years, 70, there's a certain time period. But the one that I'm talking about, no matter if you're planning to live more 20 or 30 years, no matter how fluctuations would occur in the economy, no matter how the things would get expensive in the future, your premiums would be the same. Your benefits would be the same for the rest of your life. It would never go up, never go down. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. So I want to come from few things. Just tell me about your affordability. Hello. Susan? Yes, I'm here. Yes. Yeah. I'm saying if I can give you a price range from $50 to $100 some months, how much do you think it would be easy for you to pay everyone? What is that amount? 50 bucks. I can make sure I can get you a good cremation policy and $50. I can make sure you can cover your cremation expenses. And you can leave some good money for your loved one as well as a Trump of legacy. Okay. Okay. Let me take a look on that. I don't have a doubt. You don't have a doubt. I'm sorry. I'm talking about your knees. I'm sorry. Yeah. I just put that down. I would be my knees. Yeah. If your beneficiary is going to be your knees. Do you still want me to put your mother? Yeah. Eva? No. You could just be my knees. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just put that down. I would be my knees. You have your beneficiaries going to be your knees. Okay. I know. You could just be my knees. Me, so okay. Got you. Thank you. And in the meanwhile, how's your day been so far? You've been doing fine? Yeah. It's good. Thank you for asking. Hope you've been good too. Well, things are getting fine for me. And just a word for them. Having a cup of coffee, you know. Now, how long you've been living in the state of Laredo? Oh, no. Let's see. Oh, well, I'm not pretty much of lived out here kind of my whole life. Uh-huh. How's your experience? You have a cold weather there or hot? It's okay now. The weather is cooling off because it's fall. But it generally is nice. One time I've been to Denver in Colorado. That was a pretty wonderful city. And then. Yeah, it is. I had a very bad story. Can I share that? Oh, no. I used to. I used to. I used to live in California, San Diego. Actually, I was born in Egypt. Have you heard about Egypt? Oh, wow. Yes. I know Egypt. Egypt is a country. I've never been there. I've never been there. I've never been there. Okay. Well, it's actually famous for the pyramid. They got the pyramids there. Yes. For sure. Yes. I used to have a house there. Once I was born, my parent brought me up in California. I used to be a teacher, actually. I used to be a chemistry teacher in San Diego, California. And once I turned. One time turned. One time turned 45. I was living there in my house. I used to have a house there. I used to have a house there. There was a lot of things that happened. I was having a very good apartment. I was living there. But the government just canceled my subsidies and all that. And it took the house home. paid the taxes. I mean it was a kind of thing. I was paying the taxes from myself but it was not going through. And it would all get filled and it was getting hard for me and it doesn't take the taxes. Yeah. It was a really hard thing for me and one more thing happened to me was if you heard about that while Farr occurred two months ago. I remember that while Farr in Los Angeles I had a house in Los Angeles. Oh good news. Yeah. Would you believe that I lost my house? It was burned out. Oh my gosh. I lost my wife there. Yeah I lost my wife. Here is your God burned out. Yep she got burned out. I'm sorry. It was a terrible thing. You know I thankful to God because I'm still living. I still have a life. I'm really concerned about my wife. I still miss her. You know we love each other and in fact I do have two daughters but you know I was there after that incident. But they got their own husband. They're just busy with them. I was considering myself like if I can live there with my daughter it is going to be easy for me. But it was it was kind of thing that I was thinking myself like I am kind of burdened on them. So then I moved and I moved to different states and right now I'm in the state of Ohio. I'm doing this full time job cover my expenses. Okay. I got retired at that time. I used to be a teacher and I got retired. That was really hard. I'm sure. Tell me about it to yourself. What is the hard thing that you ever say in your life? Probably multiple school experiences. It's hard. So read your hair about it. I mean it's not it's not horrible. I get treatment like every six months for my mother's clothes. Overall my health is pretty good. I can walk. You're still young. I mean you are just how old you are? You are just 54 years old right? Right. I am. So see you're you're a young lady and you sound like you're 30 or 35 years young lady. What you believe that? What's your secret? Tell me your secret. I don't know. I don't know. Drinking coffee in the morning. Maybe you're taking good care of yourself. Maybe you're doing the exercise, taking the good breakfast. Yeah, I do yoga. Oh you do yoga. I do meditation. No, we are similar. Do you know about the meditation? Yes. I do meditation too. That's a great choice. If someone is doing meditation they know their future like they're ahead of the five years. They know their future. How it's going to be? It's actually a good choice. How do you do yoga? Like it's the sitting or you have to just be neutral not thinking anything. Pretty much neutral. Yeah, neutral. Yes. From Southern California. And I've been with her for many years. Okay, that's fine. That's good. I appreciate that. I mean, you have to be neutral. You have to stop thinking about anything else. Just focusing on one thing. And that is to be neutral. And you get a lot in return. You get your physical health right. It is good for your mental health. Yeah, that's a great choice. Any other habits you have? No. Never have to lean down habits. So I've never smoked. I'm sorry, would you repeat it? I said, I've never smoked. Never. I never smoked too. Let's get for our health. We don't want to clog up our lungs. What about your husband? I'm not living here. No, you're not married. I have not. Oh, like, you don't have a husband, right? No. No, not anymore. I think that's hard for you to imagine the things you're still living alone. I live with my mother. You live with your mother? Yes. Is that easy for you? Is that easy for you? Yeah. Yeah, it's good. She put in my chest. More power to you. Yes. I'm still taking the good coverage. I do work with most of the carriers like Trans-America, Michelin Famaha, Affleck, America, Comma, and working with a lot of carriers. I still want to help you out with the better things. The cheapest one and the better one. Thank you. One of the things is AIG. I want to see that take a look for the American Genome. That's called AIG. I'm using the AIG for five years. It's working amazing for me. I'm going to make sure you can receive all the benefits that I mentioned you. It's going to be with you for the rest of your life so you can receive your policy papers. Making sure that you're not keeping those burdens on your family members, on your loved ones is a kind of thing that are making you sensible. So you have to have a policy that is going to be very good for you. I have a very good choice for you honey. I want you to grab a piece of pen and paper. I'm going to put it on.

You have your pen and paper. The plan I'm seeing here is called AIG. AIG is one of the wonderful plans that I do at present. With the AIG. As I told you, as I mentioned you're affordability. You said you're $4.50 a month. $1.18 monthly premium. What you are getting is $11,000 coverage amount. And with this $11,000 coverage amount, you're going to be getting all those benefits that I mentioned. Okay. Yes ma'am. It's going to be working really amazing for you. Okay. It takes a look. You can write it down. Okay. $11,000 for $51.18. That's what you have to pay. That's a really good choice. Why? Because I'm getting the expensive policy. I've been paying around $61 for $10,000 policy. It's not in here because she just got a $51,000 for $11,000. Why? Because you're not a smoker. That is a plus point for you. What's your email address? It's ongoing dot croixrenty.com and dot for at Yahoo dot com. Right. Okay. At Yahoo dot com. Yeah, my first dot last name at Yahoo dot com. I guess. Thank you so much. Okay.

Yes, ma'am. You got to make sure that you have a money in your account. Okay. On that date, you got to make sure you have the money in your account to insurance policy with the money at $51. I think that's okay. It's going to make sure that it's going to be very amazing for you. And I would have said that password for you. Nobody else would talk to you about life insurance. I'm going to show the time people just my skydew and try to put you on how life insurance plan already don't want that.

Because of my MS and unfortunately we have terminus. Okay. Okay. I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. Okay. I've had it for a long time. I'm going to make it real quick for you. I'm going to make sure I recall to the next person. It's going to be a quick thing. Okay. You have to tell that person that you need to have this American General Plan, that AIG Plan. Okay. Yes.

233. [555.0s - 556.0s]: Yeah.
234. [556.0s - 558.0s]: I just don't have any of it.
235. [558.0s - 559.0s]: Okay.
236. [559.0s - 560.0s]: No problem.
237. [560.0s - 561.0s]: That's fine.
238. [561.0s - 562.0s]: Let's move on.
239. [562.0s - 564.0s]: Let's talk about your life insurance.
240. [564.0s - 565.0s]: Okay.
241. [565.0s - 568.0s]: Are you a believer of cremation or burial?
242. [568.0s - 570.0s]: I have a cremated.
243. [570.0s - 572.0s]: You want to be cremated?
244. [572.0s - 577.0s]: If I can give you a price ranges from $50 to $100 a month.
245. [577.0s - 583.0s]: How much do you think you would easily afford to pay so I can get you a good policy in your budget?
246. [583.0s - 584.0s]: Yeah.
247. [584.0s - 589.0s]: I already have a lot of stuff already paid for.
248. [589.0s - 590.0s]: Yeah.
249. [590.0s - 592.0s]: But be a replacing that with others.
250. [592.0s - 595.0s]: That's what I'm saying.
251. [595.0s - 598.0s]: I'm just going to go through the next two society.
252. [598.0s - 599.0s]: Hold on a second.
253. [599.0s - 601.0s]: Next two society?
254. [601.0s - 602.0s]: Yes.
255. [602.0s - 603.0s]: Hello?
256. [603.0s - 604.0s]: I'm here.
257. [604.0s - 605.0s]: Hi, folks.
258. [605.0s - 606.0s]: Okay.
259. [606.0s - 607.0s]: Yeah.
260. [607.0s - 608.0s]: I don't know.
261. [608.0s - 610.0s]: Somebody else tried calling.
262. [610.0s - 613.0s]: I just tried answering their lines.
263. [613.0s - 621.0s]: I'm just going to go through.
264. [621.0s - 625.0s]: What I'm saying is the policy that I'm going to provide you today.
265. [625.0s - 628.0s]: This is going to be very amazing for you.
266. [628.0s - 635.0s]: Okay.
267. [635.0s - 636.0s]: Okay.
268. [636.0s - 639.0s]: You have already chose something.
269. [639.0s - 642.0s]: Do the next society.
270. [642.0s - 645.0s]: But that is the Trump life insurance plan, honey.
271. [645.0s - 649.0s]: Do you know the difference between whole life and Trump life?
272. [650.0s - 651.0s]: No.
273. [651.0s - 654.0s]: Let me explain you that.
274. [654.0s - 660.0s]: Trump life is for the fixed period of time like after five or ten years,
275. [660.0s - 667.0s]: Trump life insurance plan expires on you and all the money that you paid in terms of monthly premiums.
276. [667.0s - 672.0s]: All the money directly goes to the insurance company and you cannot get anything in return.
277. [672.0s - 674.0s]: That's a Trump life insurance plan.
278. [674.0s - 680.0s]: What I'm providing you today is the whole life insurance plan that would be with you for the rest of your life.
279. [680.0s - 683.0s]: It would never in, never expire on you.
280. [683.0s - 684.0s]: Okay.
281. [684.0s - 685.0s]: Okay.
282. [685.0s - 686.0s]: Yes, ma'am.
283. [686.0s - 688.0s]: So that's what I'm saying.
284. [688.0s - 691.0s]: I can get you a good policy today.
285. [691.0s - 698.0s]: I want to make sure that nobody like nothing is going to come out of your check before your draft date.
286. [698.0s - 702.0s]: I want to make sure I would provide you with a policy number today.
287. [702.0s - 707.0s]: We just need to submit your application and get you the approval.
288. [707.0s - 709.0s]: We don't need the money today.
289. [709.0s - 710.0s]: Okay.
290. [710.0s - 711.0s]: Okay.
291. [711.0s - 714.0s]: That's why I'm asking about your, yes, ma'am.
292. [714.0s - 718.0s]: That's why I'm asking about your affordability.
293. [718.0s - 725.0s]: Like how much you easily afford to pay every month so I can get you a good policy where you can get the day one coverage,
294. [725.0s - 730.0s]: the 200% accidental death benefit, and the cash value benefits as well.
295. [730.0s - 734.0s]: Do you know what the cash value is?
296. [734.0s - 738.0s]: Yes, I know what cash value is.
297. [738.0s - 739.0s]: Yeah.
298. [739.0s - 744.0s]: On the Trump life plan that you're talking about, that you're planning to have, you would not get these kind of benefits.
299. [744.0s - 745.0s]: Okay.
300. [745.0s - 751.0s]: And basically on the term life insurance plan, it just expires on you after some time.
301. [751.0s - 755.0s]: Like once you turn 60 years, 70, there's a certain time period.
302. [755.0s - 764.0s]: But the one that I'm talking about, no matter if you're planning to live more 20 or 30 years, no matter how fluctuations would occur in the economy,
303. [764.0s - 769.0s]: no matter how the things would get expensive in the future, your premiums would be the same.
304. [769.0s - 771.0s]: Your benefits would be the same for the rest of your life.
305. [771.0s - 774.0s]: It would never go up, never go down.
306. [774.0s - 775.0s]: Okay.
307. [775.0s - 776.0s]: Okay.
308. [776.0s - 777.0s]: Okay.
309. [777.0s - 778.0s]: All right.
310. [778.0s - 779.0s]: All right.
311. [781.0s - 786.0s]: So I want to come from few things.
312. [786.0s - 796.0s]: Just tell me about your affordability.
313. [796.0s - 797.0s]: Hello.
314. [797.0s - 798.0s]: Susan?
315. [798.0s - 799.0s]: Yes, I'm here.
316. [799.0s - 800.0s]: Yes.
317. [800.0s - 801.0s]: Yeah.
318. [801.0s - 807.0s]: I'm saying if I can give you a price range from $50 to $100 some months,
319. [807.0s - 814.0s]: how much do you think it would be easy for you to pay everyone?
320. [814.0s - 817.0s]: What is that amount?
321. [817.0s - 819.0s]: 50 bucks.
322. [819.0s - 825.0s]: I can make sure I can get you a good cremation policy and $50.
323. [825.0s - 828.0s]: I can make sure you can cover your cremation expenses.
324. [828.0s - 833.0s]: And you can leave some good money for your loved one as well as a Trump of legacy.
325. [833.0s - 834.0s]: Okay.
326. [834.0s - 835.0s]: Okay.
327. [835.0s - 836.0s]: Let me take a look on that.
328. [836.0s - 837.0s]: I don't have a doubt.
329. [837.0s - 838.0s]: You don't have a doubt.
330. [838.0s - 839.0s]: I'm sorry.
331. [839.0s - 840.0s]: I'm talking about your knees.
332. [840.0s - 841.0s]: I'm sorry.
333. [841.0s - 842.0s]: Yeah.
334. [842.0s - 843.0s]: I just put that down.
335. [843.0s - 844.0s]: I would be my knees.
336. [844.0s - 845.0s]: Yeah.
337. [845.0s - 847.0s]: If your beneficiary is going to be your knees.
338. [847.0s - 850.0s]: Do you still want me to put your mother?
339. [850.0s - 851.0s]: Yeah.
340. [851.0s - 852.0s]: Eva?
341. [852.0s - 853.0s]: No.
342. [853.0s - 855.0s]: You could just be my knees.
343. [855.0s - 856.0s]: I'm sorry.
344. [856.0s - 857.0s]: I'm sorry.
345. [857.0s - 858.0s]: I just put that down.
346. [858.0s - 859.0s]: I would be my knees.
347. [859.0s - 862.0s]: You have your beneficiaries going to be your knees.
348. [862.0s - 863.0s]: Okay.
349. [863.0s - 864.0s]: I know.
350. [864.0s - 865.0s]: You could just be my knees.
351. [865.0s - 866.0s]: Me, so okay.
352. [866.0s - 867.0s]: Got you.
