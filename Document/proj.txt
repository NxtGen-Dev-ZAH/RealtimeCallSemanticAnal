## 1.     
 Introduction 

 
 
Customer-agent interactions
 in call centers hold valuable insights into customer mood, intent,

 
 
and buying probability.
 Traditional sentiment analysis focuses only on positive/negative
 classification, but real conversations involve tone, emotions, and
 conversational flow. This project aims to build an AI-powered system that
 analyzes both audio and text features from call recordings to predict the
 probability of a sale. The system will also provide visual dashboards to help
 call center managers improve strategies.

 
 
## 2.     
 Literature
 Review

 
 
1. IBM Watson
 Tone Analyzer – Detects emotions in text but lacks audio analysis. Shortcoming:
 No multimodal support.

 
 
2. Amazon
 Contact Lens – Provides transcription + sentiment but costly. Shortcoming: Not
 open-source/student-friendly.

 
 
3. Google Cloud
 Speech + Sentiment – Speech to text + sentiment but no sale prediction.
 Shortcoming: Limited integration.

## 4.      Problem Statement

 
 
Call centers struggle to
 identify customer intent and predict the likelihood of sales during calls.
 Existing systems either provide only basic sentiment analysis or are too
 costly. There is no affordable, open-source solution that combines audio, text,
 and temporal sentiment into a predictive model for sale probability. This
 project aims to solve that gap.

 
 
## 5.     
 Problem
 Solution

 
 
The proposed solution is a
 multimodal sentiment analysis system using Whisper for transcription,
 Pyannote.audio for speaker diarization, BERT/DistilBERT for text sentiment,
 CNN+LSTM for audio emotion detection, and XGBoost/LSTM for sale prediction.
 Outputs include dashboards with sentiment curves, conversion probability, and
 agent insights.

 
 
## 6.     
 Advantages/Benefits
 of proposed system

 
 
• Detects customer mood and
 objections.

 
 
• Predicts sale probability
 (0–100%).

 
 
• Provides visual
 sentiment/emotion curves.

 
 
• Improves agent
 performance feedback.

 
 
• Uses free/open-source
 tools (student-friendly).

 
 
• Can be extended for
 real-time analysis.

 
 
## 7.     
 Scope
